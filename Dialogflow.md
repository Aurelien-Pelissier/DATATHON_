Dialogflow is a natural language understanding platform that makes it easy to design and integrate a conversational user interface into your mobile app, web application, device, bot, interactive voice response system, and so on. Using Dialogflow, you can provide new and engaging ways for users to interact with your product.

Dialogflow can analyze multiple types of input from your customers, including text or audio inputs (like from a phone or voice recording). It can also respond to your customers in a couple of ways, either through text or with synthetic speech.

Dialogflow CX and ES

Dialogflow provides two different virtual agent services, each of which has its own agent type, user interface, API, client libraries, and documentation:

Dialogflow CX	Provides an advanced agent type suitable for large or very complex agents.
Dialogflow ES	Provides the standard agent type suitable for small and simple agents.
The following documentation is common to both CX and ES:

Editions	Detailed comparison of editions and agent types.
Support	Support options, FAQ, troubleshooting, etc.
Resources	Pricing, quotas, release notes, etc.
Conversational AI
Dialogflow is part of the Conversational AI offering within Google Cloud:

Conversational AI	Learn more about the Conversational AI offering within Google Cloud.
Learning Hub	Learning resources to blogs, best practices, codebases, videos etc.
Agent Assist
Dialogflow CX and ES provide virtual agent services for chatbots and contact centers. If you have a contact center that employs human agents, you can use Agent Assist to help your human agents. Agent Assist provides real-time suggestions for human agents while they are in conversations with end-user customers.

The Agent Assist API is implemented as an extension of the Dialogflow ES API. When browsing the Dialogflow ES API, you will see these additional types and methods. Even though Agent Assist is an extension of the Dialogflow ES API, you can use a Dialogflow CX agent type as the virtual agent for Agent Assist. If you are only using a Dialogflow virtual agent, you can ignore these extensions.
